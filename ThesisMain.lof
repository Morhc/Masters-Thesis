The convective velocities computing using MLT agree with the spherically averaged 3D velocities to within about a factor of 2 inside the convection zone but are too large in the vicinity of the CB, resulting in an overestimation of the diffusion coefficient there. Limiting the mixing length to the distance from the CB reproduces the fall-off of the diffusion coefficient inside the convection zone approaching the boundary which is seen in the spherically averaged 3D simulation results. }}{22}{figure.caption.17}%
