\section{Light Odd-Z Isotope Production}

The $p$-nuclei are not the sole unique nucleosynthetic feature of O-C shell mergers.
The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc have all been noted as products as well  \cite{ritterConvectivereactiveNucleosynthesisSc2018, robertiOccurrenceImpactCarbonOxygen2025}.
These elements are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution calculations (citation?) and there exist observations of P-enhanced stars that may be explained by this \cite{masseronPhosphorusrichStarsUnusual2020, braunerUnveilingChemicalFingerprint2023, braunerUnveilingChemicalFingerprint2024}.

Here, we will explore how the stable isotopes for these elements are produced in merger.

\begin{itemize}
    \item I think I want that table that breaks down the nuclear physics impacts 
    \item Maybe some nice figures also mimicing the paper figures
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Relevance of K}

The production of K in particular is of interest due to its relevance in the formation of exoplanets and whether they have an Earth-like atmosphere habitable for life \cite{frankRadiogenicHeatingEvolution2014, oneillEffectGalacticChemical2020}.

We can investigate the K isotopes $^{39}\mathrm{K}$, $^{40}\mathrm{K}$, and $^{41}\mathrm{K}$ more in detail.
