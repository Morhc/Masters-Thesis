The following work has been written and prepared for submission to peer-review.
Small changes have been made to fit the thesis format, but the content remains unchanged.
All work was done in collaboration with my supervisor Dr.\ Falk Herwig and from Dr.\ Pavel Denissenkov.
Dr.\ Denissenkov supplied the initial code used to create the post-processed models, analysis tools, and training necessary to understand how to use the code.
I have modified this code and created new tools to perform the analysis, but his contributions were essential to the inital stages.
Dr.\ Herwig has provided guidance and support throughout the project in his role as my supervisor.
