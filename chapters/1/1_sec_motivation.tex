\section{Motivation}

1-D stellar evolution is a field that depends on the assumptions of spherical symmetry and mixing length theory.
While these assumptions are able to describe the early nuclear burning stages of massive stars, they break down in the advanced burning stages.
The convective O-burning shell and its potential merger with a convective C-burning shell are advanced burning stages shortly before the core collapse of a star where 1-D assumptions break down and 3-D hydrodynamics becomes necessary to model the macrophysical flows \citep{meakinTurbulentConvectionStellar2007, jonesIdealizedHydrodynamicSimulations2017, andrassy3DHydrodynamicSimulations2020}.
This poses a problem for nucleosynthesis calculations, as the stellar structure can be complex, with asymmetric hotspots of burning leading to substantial differences in production compared to 1-D \citep{bazanConvectionNucleosynthesisCore1994, rizzutiShellMergersLate2024a}.
