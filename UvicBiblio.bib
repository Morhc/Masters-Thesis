  abstract = {Interactions between convective shells in evolved massive stars have been linked to supernova impostors, to the production of the odd-Z elements Cl, K, and Sc, and they might also help generate the large-scale asphericities that are known to facilitate shock revival in supernova explosion models. We investigate the process of ingestion of C-shell material into a convective O-burning shell, including the hydrodynamic feedback from the nuclear burning of the ingested material. Our 3D hydrodynamic simulations span almost 3 dex in the total luminosity Ltot. All but one of the simulations reach a quasi-stationary state with the entrainment rate and convective velocity proportional to Ltot and L\_tot{\textasciicircum}\{1/3\}, respectively. Carbon burning provides 14-33 per cent of the total luminosity, depending on the set of reactions considered. Equivalent simulations done on 7683 and 11523 grids are in excellent quantitative agreement. The flow is dominated by a few large-scale convective cells. An instability leading to large-scale oscillations with Mach numbers in excess of 0.2 develops in an experimental run with the energy yield from C burning increased by a factor of 10. This run represents most closely the conditions expected in a violent O-C shell merger, which is a potential production site for odd-Z elements such as K and Sc and which may seed asymmetries in the supernova progenitor. 1D simulations may underestimate the energy generation from the burning of ingested material by as much as a factor 2 owing to their missing the effect of clumpiness of entrained material on the nuclear reaction rate.},

  abstract = {This work investigates the properties of convection in stars with particular emphasis on entrainment across the upper convective boundary (CB). Idealized simulations of turbulent convection in the O-burning shell of a massive star are performed in 4{$\pi$} geometry on 7683 and 15363 grids, driven by a representative heating rate. A heating series is also performed on the 7683 grid. The 15363 simulation exhibits an entrainment rate at the upper CB of 1.33 {\texttimes} 10-6 M{$\odot$} s-1. The 7683 simulation with the same heating rate agrees within 17 per cent. The entrainment rate at the upper CB is found to scale linearly with the driving luminosity and with the cube of the shear velocity at the upper boundary, while the radial rms fluid velocity scales with the cube root of the driving luminosity, as expected. The mixing is analysed in a 1D diffusion framework, resulting in a simple model for CB mixing. The analysis confirms that limiting the MLT mixing length to the distance to the CB in 1D simulations better represents the spherically averaged radial velocity profiles from the 3D simulations and provide an improved determination of the reference diffusion coefficient D0 for the exponential diffusion CB mixing model in 1D. From the 3D simulation data, we adopt as the CB the location of the maximum gradient in the horizontal velocity component which has 2{$\sigma$} spatial fluctuations of {$\approx$}0.17HP. The exponentially decaying diffusion CB mixing model with f = 0.03 reproduces the spherically averaged 3D abundance profiles.},

Metallicity-dependent mass-loss, convective boundary mixing in low- and intermediate-mass models and H and He core burning massive star models are included. Convective O-C shell mergers in some stellar models lead to the strong production of odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc. In AGB models with hot dredge-up, the convective boundary mixing efficiency is reduced to accommodate for its energetic feedback.

  abstract = {One-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution models are widely used across various astrophysical fields, however they are still dominated by important uncertainties that deeply affect their predictive power. Among those, the merging of independent convective regions is a poorly understood phenomenon predicted by some 1D models but whose occurrence and impact in real stars remain very uncertain. Being an intrinsically multi-D phenomenon, it is challenging to predict the exact behaviour of shell mergers with 1D models. In this work, we conduct a detailed investigation of a multiple shell merging event in a 20 M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ star using 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Making use of the active tracers for composition and the nuclear network included in the 3D model, we study the merging not only from a dynamical standpoint but also considering its nucleosynthesis and energy generation. Our simulations confirm the occurrence of the merging also in 3D, but reveal significant differences from the 1D case. Specifically, we identify entrainment and the erosion of stable regions as the main mechanisms that drive the merging, we predict much faster convective velocities compared to the mixing-length theory velocities, and observe multiple burning phases within the same merged shell, with important effects for the chemical composition of the star, which presents a strongly asymmetric (dipolar) distribution. We expect that these differences will have important effects on the final structure of massive stars and thus their final collapse dynamics and possible supernova explosion, subsequently affecting the resulting nucleosynthesis and remnant.},

Further, we investigated the contribution of C--O shell mergers in the supernova progenitors as an additional site of the {$\gamma$}-process. Results. Our analysis shows that a large scatter among the different models exists for both the {$\gamma$}-process integrated yields and the isotopic ratios. We find only ten ratios that agree with their solar values, all the others differ by at least a factor of three from the solar values in all the considered sets of models.

We conclude that there are large discrepancies both among the different data sets and between the model predictions and the solar abundance distribution. More calculations are needed; particularly updating the nuclear network, because the majority of the models considered in this work do not use the latest reaction rates for the {$\gamma$}-process nucleosynthesis.

We explored the effect of varying the explosion parameters on the \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$}-nucleus production in two sets of CCSN models with initial masses of 15, 20, and 25 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} at solar metallicity. We calculated a new set of 24 CCSN models (eight for each stellar progenitor mass) and compared our results with another recently published set of 80 CCSN models that includes a wide range of explosion parameters: explosion energy or initial shock velocity, energy injection time, and mass location of the injection.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that the total \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$}-nucleus yields are only marginally affected by the CCSN explosion prescriptions if the \emph{{$\gamma<$}i/{$>$}-process production is already efficient in the stellar progenitors due to a C-O shell merger. In most CCSN explosions from progenitors without a C-O shell merger, the \emph{{$\gamma<$}i/{$>$}-process yields increase with the explosion energy by up to an order of magnitude, depending on the progenitor structure and the CCSN prescriptions. The general trend of the \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$}-nucleus production with the explosion energy is more complicated if we look at the production of single \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$} nuclei. The light \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$}-nuclei tend to be the most enhanced with increasing explosion energy. In particular, for the CCSN models where the \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}-rich freeze-out component is ejected, the yields of the lightest \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$} nuclei (including \textsuperscript{92, 94{$<$}sup/{$>$}Mo and \textsuperscript{96{$<$}sup/{$>$}Ru) increase by up to three orders of magnitude.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} We provide the first extensive study using different sets of massive stars of the impact of varying CCSN explosion prescriptions on the production of \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$} nuclei. Unlike previous expectations and recent results in the literature, we find that the average production of \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$} nuclei tends to increase with the explosion energy. We also confirm that the pre-explosion production of \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$} nuclei in C-O shell mergers is a robust result, independent of the subsequent explosive nucleosynthesis. More generally, a realistic range of variations in the evolution of stellar progenitors and in the CCSN explosions might boost the CCSN contribution to the galactic chemical evolution of \emph{p{$<$}i/{$>$} nuclei.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Depending on mass and metallicity as well as evolutionary phase, stars occasionally experience convective--reactive nucleosynthesis episodes. We specifically investigate the situation when nucleosynthetically unprocessed, H-rich material is convectively mixed with an He-burning zone, for example in a convectively unstable shell on top of electron-degenerate cores in asymptotic giant branch stars, young white dwarfs, or X-ray bursting neutron stars. Such episodes are frequently encountered in stellar evolution models of stars of extremely low or zero metal content, such as the first stars. We have carried out detailed nucleosynthesis simulations based on stellar evolution models and informed by hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on the convective--reactive episode in the very late thermal pulse star Sakurai's object (V4334 Sagittarii). Asplund et al. determined the abundances of 28 elements, many of which are highly non-solar, ranging from H, He, and Li all the way to Ba and La, plus the C isotopic ratio. Our simulations show that the mixing evolution according to standard, one-dimensional stellar evolution models implies neutron densities in the He intershell ({$\lessequivlnt$} few 1011 cm-3) that are too low to obtain a significant neutron capture nucleosynthesis on the heavy elements. We have carried out three-dimensional hydrodynamic He-shell flash convection simulations in 4{$\pi$} geometry to study the entrainment of H-rich material. Guided by these simulations we assume that the ingestion process of H into the He-shell convection zone leads only after some delay time to a sufficient entropy barrier that splits the convection zone into the original one driven by He burning and a new one driven by the rapid burning of ingested H. By making such mixing assumptions that are motivated by our hydrodynamic simulations we obtain significantly higher neutron densities ({$\sim$} few 1015 cm-3) and reproduce the key observed abundance trends found in Sakurai's object. These include an overproduction of Rb, Sr, and Y by about two orders of magnitude higher than the overproduction of Ba and La. Such a peculiar nucleosynthesis signature is impossible to obtain with the mixing predictions in our one-dimensional stellar evolution models. The simulated Li abundance and the isotopic ratio 12C/13C are as well in agreement with observations. Details of the observed heavy element abundances can be used as a sensitive diagnostic tool for the neutron density, for the neutron exposure and, in general, for the physics of the convective--reactive phases in stellar evolution. For example, the high elemental ratio Sc/Ca and the high Sc production indicate high neutron densities. The diagnostic value of such abundance markers depends on uncertain nuclear physics input. We determine how our results depend on uncertainties of nuclear reaction rates, for example for the 13C({$\alpha$}, n)16O reaction.},

We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of this intermediate-process (i-process) nucleosynthesis to determine the impact of (n,{$\gamma$}) reaction rate uncertainties of 164 unstable isotopes, from 131I to 189Hf, on the predicted abundances of 18 elements from Ba to W. The impact study is based on two representative one-zone models with constant values of Nn = 3.16 {\texttimes} 1014 and 3.16 {\texttimes} 1013 cm-3 and on a multizone model based on a realistic stellar evolution simulation of He-shell convection entraining H in a RAWD model with [Fe/H] = -2.6. For each of the selected elements, we have identified up to two (n,{$\gamma$}) reactions having the strongest correlations between their rate variations constrained by Hauser-Feshbach computations and the predicted abundances, with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients {\textbar}rP{\textbar} {$>$} 0.15. We find that the discrepancies between the predicted and observed abundances of Ba and Pr in the CEMP-i star CS 31062-050 are significantly diminished if the rate of 137Cs(n,{$\gamma$})138Cs is reduced and the rates of 141Ba(n,{$\gamma$})142Ba or 141La(n,{$\gamma$})142La increased. The uncertainties of temperature-dependent {$\beta$}-decay rates of the same unstable isotopes have a negligible effect on the predicted abundances. One-zone Monte Carlo simulations can be used instead of computationally time-consuming multizone Monte Carlo simulations in reaction rate uncertainty studies if they use comparable values of Nn. We discuss the key challenges that RAWD simulations of i process for CEMP-i stars meet by contrasting them with recently published low-Z asymptotic giant branch (AGB) i process.},

We estimate the nuclear physics uncertainties in the i-process model predictions to determine whether the remaining discrepancies with observations are significant and point to potential issues with the underlying astrophysical model. We find that the dominant source in the nuclear physics uncertainties are predictions of neutron capture rates on unstable neutron rich nuclei, which can have uncertainties of more than a factor 20 in the band of the i-process. We use a Monte Carlo variation of 52 neutron capture rates and a 1D multi-zone post-processing model for the i-process in Sakurai's object to determine the cumulative effect of these uncertainties on the final elemental abundance predictions. We find that the nuclear physics uncertainties are large and comparable to observational errors. Within these uncertainties the model predictions are consistent with observations. A correlation analysis of the results of our MC simulations reveals that the strongest impact on the predicted abundances of Rb, Sr, Y and Zr is made by the uncertainties in the (n, {$\gamma$}) reaction rates of 85Br, 86Br, 87Kr, 88Kr, 89Kr, 89Rb, 89Sr, and 92Sr. This conclusion is supported by a series of multi-zone simulations in which we increased and decreased to their maximum and minimum limits one or two reaction rates per run. We also show that simple and fast one-zone simulations should not be used instead of more realistic multi-zone stellar simulations for nuclear sensitivity and uncertainty studies of convective-reactive processes.

  abstract = {With currently known input physics and computer simulations in one dimension, a self-consistent treatment of core-collapse supernovae does not yet lead to successful explosions, while two-dimensional models show some promise. Thus, there are strong indications that the delayed neutrino mechanism works combined with a multidimensional convection treatment for unstable layers (possibly with the aid of rotation, magnetic fields and/or still existent uncertainties in neutrino opacities). On the other hand, there is a need to provide correct nucleosynthesis abundances for the progressing field of galactic evolution and observations of low-metallicity stars. The innermost ejecta is directly affected by the explosion mechanism, i.e., most strongly, the yields of Fe group nuclei for which an induced piston or thermal bomb treatment will not provide the correct yields because the effect of neutrino interactions is not included. We apply parameterized variations to the neutrino-scattering cross sections in order to mimic in one dimension the possible increase of neutrino luminosities caused by uncertainties in proto-neutron star convection. Alternatively, parameterized variations are applied to the neutrino absorption cross sections on nucleons in the ``gain region'' to mimic the increase in neutrino energy deposition enabled by convective turnover. We find that both measures lead to similar results, causing explosions and a Ye{$>$}0.5 in the innermost ejected layers, due to the combined effect of a short weak-interaction timescale and a negligible electron degeneracy, unveiling the proton-neutron mass difference. We include all weak interactions (electron and positron capture, {$\beta$}-decay, neutrino and antineutrino capture on nuclei, and neutrino and antineutrino capture on nucleons) and present first nucleosynthesis results for these innermost ejected layers to discuss how they improve predictions for Fe group nuclei. The proton-rich environment results in enhanced abundances of 45Sc, 49Ti, and 64Zn as required by chemical evolution studies and observations of low-metallicity stars, as well as appreciable production of nuclei in the mass range up to A=80.},

  abstract = {A small number of naturally occurring, proton-rich nuclides (the p-nuclei) cannot be made in the s- and r-process. Their origin is not well understood. Massive stars can produce p-nuclei through photodisintegration of pre-existing intermediate and heavy nuclei. This so-called gamma-process requires high stellar plasma temperatures and occurs mainly in explosive O/Ne burning during a core-collapse supernova. Although the gamma-process in massive stars has been successful in producing a large range of p-nuclei, significant deficiences remain. An increasing number of processes and sites has been studied in recent years in search of viable alternatives replacing or supplementing the massive star models. A large number of unstable nuclei, however, with only theoretically predicted reaction rates are included in the reaction network and thus the nuclear input may also bear considerable uncertainties. The current status of astrophysical models, nuclear input, and observational constraints is reviewed. After an overview of currently discussed models, the focus is on the possibility to better constrain those models through different means. Meteoritic data not only provide the actual isotopic abundances of the p-nuclei but can also put constraints on the possible contribution of proton-rich nucleosynthesis. The main part of the review focusses on the nuclear uncertainties involved in the determination of the astrophysical reaction rates required for the extended reaction networks used in nucleosynthesis studies. Experimental approaches are discussed together with their necessary connection to theory, which is especially pronounced for reactions with intermediate and heavy nuclei in explosive nuclear burning, even close to stability.},

Improved nuclear reaction rates and an extended reaction network are used. The latter includes elements between carbon and bismuth and treats self-consistently the neutron, proton and alpha-particle production and captures. Starting with a seed nuclei distribution resulting from an s-process in the helium burning core of a massive star, a p-nuclei abundance pattern is obtained which compares to the solar one within a factor 3 for 60 percent of the p-nuclei. Further test calculations are performed in order to study the effects on the p-process yields of neutron-induced reactions, as well as of the expansion time scale characterizing the explosion. The underproduction of Mo-92, Mo-94, and Ru-96 observed in earlier works, remains in the calculations. A few other nuclides which are classically considered as p-nuclei are also synthesized in insufficient amounts, and an s-process origin for these nuclei is discussed.},

Use is made of detailed pre-supernova and explosion models. Special attention is also paid to the evaluation of the abundances of the s-process seeds, while the p-process nucleosynthesis is computed with the aid of an extended reaction network. In addition, the impact of some key nuclear physics and astrophysics uncertainties on the p-process yields is also investigated. This unprecedented effort to model the p-process allows us to set the stage of a reliable model for the evolution of the galactic content of the p-nuclides. In particular, integrated p-process yields are obtained from a convolution of the production from the individual star explosions with an Initial Mass Function. In addition, a first quantitative evaluation of the metallicity dependence of the amount of ejected p-nuclides is provided. It is found that the p-process abundance patterns do not depend drastically on the stellar mass. In all the considered cases, about 60\% of the p-nuclides are nicely co-produced (with respect to solar). The relative underproduction of the Mo and Ru p-isotopes found in previous studies is confirmed. Another problem is identified, and its extent is evaluated quantitatively for the first time. It concerns the relative global underproduction of the p-nuclides with respect to oxygen by a factor of about 4, when normalized to the solar system values. However, it is claimed that various uncertainties of an astrophysical or nuclear physics nature that can affect both the p-process and oxygen yields do not allow one to rule out the SNII model without further scrutiny. Our predictions are also confronted with anomalies attributed to p-isotopes found in various meteoritic materials. It is found in particular that our calculated Xe isotopic composition fails to reproduce the special pattern of Xe-L loading interstellar diamonds. On the other hand, the radionuclides {\textasciicircum}92{\textasciicircum}Nb \& {\textasciicircum}146{\textasciicircum}Sm that are inferred to have been present in the early solar system are synthesized in the SNII p-process at a level that is considered to be too uncertain to allow the development of a reliable p-process chronometry.},

  abstract = {Beyond Fe, there is a class of 35 proton-rich nuclides, between 74Se and 196Hg, called p-nuclei. They are bypassed by the s and r neutron capture processes and are typically 10-1000 times less abundant than the s- and/or r-isotopes in the solar system. The bulk of p-isotopes is created in the "gamma processes" by sequences of photodisintegrations and beta decays in explosive conditions in both core collapse supernovae (SNe II) and in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). SNe II contribute to the production of p-nuclei through explosive neon and oxygen burning. However, the major problem in SN II ejecta is a general underproduction of the light p-nuclei for A {$<$} 120. We explore SNe Ia as p-process sites in the framework of a two-dimensional SN Ia delayed detonation model as well as pure deflagration models. The white dwarf precursor is assumed to have reached the Chandrasekhar mass in a binary system by mass accretion from a giant/main-sequence companion. We use enhanced s-seed distributions, with seeds directly obtained from a sequence of thermal pulse instabilities both in the asymptotic giant branch phase and in the accreted material. We apply the tracer-particle method to reconstruct the nucleosynthesis by the thermal histories of Lagrangian particles, passively advected in the hydrodynamic calculations. For each particle, we follow the explosive nucleosynthesis with a detailed nuclear reaction network for all isotopes up to 209Bi. We select tracers within the typical temperature range for p-process production, (1.5-3.7) {\texttimes} 109 K, and analyze in detail their behavior, exploring the influence of different s-process distributions on the p-process nucleosynthesis. In addition, we discuss the sensitivity of p-process production to parameters of the explosion mechanism, taking into account the consequences on Fe and alpha elements. We find that SNe Ia can produce a large amount of p-nuclei, both the light p-nuclei below A = 120 and the heavy-p nuclei, at quite flat average production factors, tightly related to the s-process seed distribution. For the first time, we find a stellar source able to produce both light and heavy p-nuclei almost at the same level as 56Fe, including the debated neutron magic 92, 94Mo and 96, 98Ru. We also find that there is an important contribution from the p-process nucleosynthesis to the s-only nuclei 80Kr, 86Sr, to the neutron magic 90Zr, and to the neutron-rich 96Zr. Finally, we investigate the metallicity effect on p-process production in our models. Starting with different s-process seed distributions for two metallicities Z = 0.02 and Z = 0.001, running two-dimensional SN Ia models with different initial composition, we estimate that SNe Ia can contribute to at least 50\% of the solar p-process composition. A more detailed analysis of the role of SNe Ia in Galactic chemical evolution of p-nuclei is in preparation.},

A novel ``adaptive'' reaction network is employed with a variable number of nuclei (adjusted each time step) ranging from {\textasciitilde}700 on the main sequence to {$>$}{\textasciitilde}2200 during the explosion. The network includes, at any given time, all relevant isotopes from hydrogen through polonium (Z=84). Even the limited grid of stellar masses studied suggests that overall good agreement can be achieved with the solar abundances of nuclei between 16O and 90Zr. Interesting discrepancies are seen in the 20 Msolar model and (so far, only in that model) are a consequence of the merging of the oxygen, neon, and carbon shells about a day prior to core collapse. We find that, in some stars, most of the ``p-process'' nuclei can be produced in the convective oxygen-burning shell moments prior to collapse; in others, they are made only in the explosion. Serious deficiencies still exist in all cases for the p-process isotopes of Ru and Mo.},

Bespoke temperature-dependent uncertainties were assigned to different types of reactions involving nuclei from Fe to Bi. Their simultaneous impact was studied in post-processing explosive trajectories for three different stellar models. It was found that the grid of mass zones in the model of a 25~M{$\odot$} star, which is widely used for investigations of p nucleosynthesis, is too crude to properly resolve the detailed temperature changes required for describing the production of p nuclei. Using models with finer grids for 15 and 25~M{$\odot$} stars with initial solar metallicity, it was found that most of the production uncertainties introduced by nuclear reaction uncertainties are smaller than a factor of 2. Since a large number of rates were varied at the same time in the Monte Carlo procedure, possible cancellation effects of several uncertainties could be taken into account. Key rates were identified for each p nucleus, which provide the dominant contribution to the production uncertainty. These key rates were found by examining correlations between rate variations and resulting abundance changes. This method is superior to studying flow patterns, especially when the flows are complex, and to individual, sequential variation of a few rates.},

In such conditions, a great number of p-elements might be overproduced in ratios close to their solar values if a superposition of at least three abundance distributions corresponding to somewhat different temperatures (2-2.2 billion K), neutron concentrations (.01 to 1.0 quadrillion/cu cm), and eventually time scales. These distributions are meant to account for the p-elements in the three mass number ranges 0 to 98, 102-about 144, and about 144 to 196; the agreement between theoretical and observed abundances is the worst for the first of these three classes.

  abstract = {The p-process of stellar nucleosynthesis is aimed at explaining the production of the stable neutron-deficient nuclides heavier than iron that are observed up to now in the solar system exclusively. Various scenarios have been proposed to account for the bulk p-nuclide content of the solar system, as well as for deviations (`anomalies') with respect to the bulk p-isotope composition of some elements discovered in primitive meteorites. The astrophysics of these models is reviewed, and the involved nuclear physics is discussed, including a brief account of recent experimental efforts. Already published results are complemented with new ones. A specific attention is paid to the very rare odd--odd nuclides 138La and 180Tam, as well as to the puzzling case of the light Mo and Ru isotopes. Astrophysics and nuclear physics prospects of improvements in the p-process modeling are presented.},

Significant mixing beyond convective boundaries determined by mixing-length theory brings fuel (C-12) into the convective region, causing hot spots of nuclear burning. Plumes dominate the velocity structure. Finite perturbations arise in a region in which O-16 will be explosively burned to Ni-56 when the star explodes; the resulting instabilities and mixing are likely to distribute Ni-56 throughout the supernova envelope. Inhomogeneities in Ye may be large enough to affect core collapse and will affect explosive nucleosynthesis. The nature of convective burning is dramatically different from that assumed in one-dimensional simulations; quantitative estimates of nucleosynthetic yields, core masses, and the approach to core collapse will be affected.},

It is found that a large part of the nuclear flow in the r-process may be carried by charged particle reactions up to about A of about 100. It is speculated that the site of these processes is the high-entropy 'wind' of a young neutron star in which neutrino energy deposition is driving mass loss. The pass of r-process ejected per supernova is expected to be about 0.0001 solar mass per Type II or Ib supernova, but this is sensitive to details of the presupernova structure, the explosion mechanism, and the amount of material that falls back onto the neutron star when the reverse shock arrives there.},

The most recent set of solar abundances, opacities, mass loss rates, and current estimates of nuclear reaction rates are employed. Restrictions on the mass cut and explosion energy of the supernovae based upon nucleosynthesis, measured neutron star masses, and light curves are discussed and applied. The nucleosynthetic results, when integrated over a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), agree quite well with what is seen in the sun. We discuss in some detail the production of the long lived radioactivities, 26Al and 60Fe, and why recent model-based estimates of the ratio 60Fe/Al are overly large compared with what satellites have observed. A major source of the discrepancy is the uncertain nuclear cross sections for the creation and destruction of these unstable isotopes.},

  abstract = {High-resolution spectroscopic observations of 100 metal-poor carbon and s-rich stars (CEMP-s) collected from the literature are compared with the theoretical nucleosynthesis models of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) presented in Paper I (MAGBini= 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2 M{$\odot$}, - 3.6 {$\lessequivlnt$} [ Fe/H ] {$\lessequivlnt$}- 1.5). The s-process enhancement detected in these objects is associated with binary systems: the more massive companion evolved faster through the thermally pulsing AGB phase (TP-AGB), synthesizing s-elements in the inner He intershell, which are partly dredged up to the surface during the third dredge-up (TDU) episode. The secondary observed low-mass companion became CEMP-s by the mass transfer of C- and s-rich material from the primary AGB. We analyse the light elements C, N, O, Na and Mg, as well as the two s-process indicators, [hs/ls] (where ls = is the the light-s peak at N = 50 and hs = the heavy-s peak at N = 82) and [Pb/hs]. We distinguish between CEMP-s with high s-process enhancement, [hs/Fe] {$>$}rsim 1.5 (CEMP-sII), and mild s-process enhanced stars, [hs/Fe] {$<$} 1.5 (CEMP-sI). To interpret the observations, a range of s-process efficiencies at any given metallicity is necessary. This is confirmed by the high spread observed in [Pb/hs] ({$\sim$}2 dex). A degeneration of solutions is found with some exceptions: most main-sequence CEMP-sII stars with low [Na/Fe] can only be interpreted with MAGBini= 1.3-1.4 M{$\odot$}. Giants having suffered the first dredge-up (FDU) need a dilution {$>$}rsim1 dex (dil is defined as the mass of the convective envelope of the observed star, Mobs\ding{72}, over the material transferred from the AGB to the companion, MtransAGB). Then AGB models with higher AGB initial masses (MAGBini= 1.5-2 M{$\odot$}) are adopted to interpret CEMP-sII giants. In general, solutions with AGB models in the mass range MAGBini= 1.3-2 M{$\odot$} and different dilution factors are found for CEMP-sI stars. About half of the CEMP-s stars with europium measurements show a high r-process enhancement (CEMP-s/r). The scenario for the origin of CEMP-s/r stars is a debated issue. We propose that the molecular cloud from which the binary system formed was previously enriched in r-process elements, most likely by local SN II pollution. This initial r-enrichment does not affect the s-process nucleosynthesis. However, for a high r-process enrichment ([r/Fe]ini= 2) the r-process contributions to solar La, Nd and Sm (30, 40 and 70 per cent) have to be considered. This increases the maximum [hs/ls] up to {$\sim$}0.3 dex. CEMP-s/r stars reflect this behaviour, showing higher [hs/ls] than observed in CEMP-s on average. Detailed analyses for individual stars will be provided in Paper III.},

The nucleosynthesis proceeds similarly to the standard {$r$} process, a sequence of neutron captures and beta decays with, however, charged-current neutrino absorption reactions on nuclei operating much faster than beta decays. Once neutron-capture reactions freeze out the produced {$r$} process, neutron-rich nuclei undergo a fast conversion of neutrons into protons and are pushed even beyond the {$B$} stability line, producing the neutron-deficient {$p$} nuclei. This scenario, which we denote as the {$\nu$}⁢{$r$} process, provides an alternative channel for the production of {$p$} nuclei and the short-lived nucleus 92Nb. We discuss the necessary conditions posed on the astrophysical site for the {$\nu$}⁢{$r$} process to be realized in nature. While these conditions are not fulfilled by current neutrino-hydrodynamic models of {$r$}-process sites, future models, including more complex physics and a larger variety of outflow conditions, may achieve the necessary conditions in some regions of the ejecta.},

The production of 19F turns out to be more sensitive to the progenitor mass and structure than to the {$\nu$}-process. With our complete set of cross sections we have identified the effects of the {$\nu$}-process on several stable nuclei including 33S, 40Ar, 41K, 59Co, and 113In at the 10\% level. Neutrino-induced reactions contribute to a similar extent to the production of radioactive 26Al and increase the yield of 22Na by 50\%. Future {$\gamma$}-ray astronomy missions may reach the sensitivity at which the contribution from the {$\nu$}-process becomes relevant. We find that the production of 22Na by the {$\nu$}-process could explain the Ne-E(L) component of meteoritic graphite grains. The {$\nu$}-process enhances the yield of 36Cl and we point out that the resulting 36Cl/35Cl ratio is in agreement with the values inferred for the early solar system. Our extended set of neutrino-nucleus interactions also allows us to exclude any further effects of the {$\nu$}-process on stable nuclei and to quantify the effects on numerous, hitherto unconsidered radioactive nuclei, e.g., 36Cl, 72As, 84Rb, and 88Y.},

Single-degenerate thermonuclear supernovae (SNIa) with n-capture nucleosynthesis seeds assembled in the external layers of the progenitor's rapidly accreting white dwarf (RAWD) phase may produce these isotopes. We calculate the stellar structure of the accretion phase of five white dwarf (WD) models with initial masses {$\geq$} 0.85 \${\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ using the stellar code MESA The near-surface layers of the 1, 1.26, 1.32 and 1.38 \${\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ models are most representative of the regions in which the bulk of the p nuclei are produced during SNIa explosions, and for these models we also calculate the neutron-capture nucleosynthesis in the external layers. Contrary to previous RAWD models at lower mass, we find that the H-shell flashes are the main site of n-capture nucleosynthesis. We find high neutron densities up to several 1015 cm-3 in the most massive WDs. Through the recurrence of the H-shell flashes these intermediate neutron densities can be sustained effectively for a long time leading to high-neutron exposures with a strong production up to Pb. Both the neutron density and the neutron exposure increase with increasing the mass of the accreting WD. Finally, the SNIa nucleosynthesis is calculated using the obtained abundances as seeds. We obtain solar to supersolar abundances for p-nuclei with A {$>$} 96. Our models show that SNIa are a viable p-process production site.},

The contribution of different stellar sources to the observed distribution of p-nuclei in the solar system is still under debate. We explore single degenerate Type Ia supernovae in the framework of two-dimensional SNIa delayed-detonation explosion models. Travaglio et al. discussed the sensitivity of p-nuclei production to different SNIa models, i.e., delayed detonations of different strength, deflagrations, and the dependence on selected s-process seed distributions. Here we present a detailed study of p-process nucleosynthesis occurring in SNIa with s-process seeds at different metallicities. Based on the delayed-detonation model DDT-a of TRV11, we analyze the dependence of p-nucleosynthesis on the s-seed distribution obtained from different strengths of the 13C pocket. We also demonstrate that 208Pb seed alone changes the p-nuclei production considerably. The heavy-s seeds (140 {$<$}=A {$<$} 208) contribute with about 30\%-40\% to the total light-p nuclei production up to 132Ba (with the exception of 94Mo and 130Ba, to which the heavy-s seeds contribute with about 15\% only). Using a Galactic chemical evolution code from Travaglio et al., we study the contribution of SNIa to the solar stable p-nuclei. We find that explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass single degenerate systems produce a large amount of p-nuclei in our Galaxy, both in the range of light (A {$<$}= 120) and heavy p-nuclei, at almost flat average production factors (within a factor of about three). We discussed in details p-isotopes such as 94Mo with a behavior diverging from the average, which we attribute to uncertainties in the nuclear data or in SNIa modeling. Li et al. find that about 70\% of all SNeIa are normal events. If these are explained in the framework of explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs resulting from the single-degenerate progenitor channel, we find that they are responsible for at least 50\% of the p-nuclei abundances in the solar system.},

  abstract = {We present nuclear reaction network calculations to investigate the influence of nuclear structure on the rp-process between Ge and Sn in various scenarios. Due to the lack of experimental data for neutron-deficient nuclei in this region, we discuss currently available model predictions for nuclear masses and deformations as well as methods of calculating reaction rates (Hauser-Feshbach) and {$\beta$}-decay rates (QRPA and shell model). In addition, we apply a valence nucleon (NpNn) correlation scheme for the prediction of masses and deformations. We also describe the calculations of 2p-capture reactions, which had not been considered before in this mass region. We find that in X-ray bursts 2p-capture reactions accelerate the reaction flow into the Z {$\geq$} 36 region considerably. Therefore, the rp-process in most X-ray bursts does not end in the Z = 32--36 region as previously assumed and overproduction factors of 107--108 are reached for some light p-nuclei in the A = 80--100 region. This might be of interest in respect of the yet unexplained large observed solar system abundances of these nuclei. Nuclei in this region can also be produced via the rp-proces in accretion disks around low mass black holes. Our results indicate that the rp-process energy production in the Z {$>$} 32 region cannot be neglected in these scenarios. We discuss in detail the influence of the various nuclear structure input parameters and their current uncertainties on these results. It turns out that rp-process nucleosynthesis is mainly determined by nuclear masses and {$\beta$}-decay rates of nuclei along the proton drip line. We present a detailed list of nuclei for which mass or {$\beta$}-decay rate measurements would be crucial to further constrain the models.},

Runs on 7683 and 15363 grids agree well with each other and have been followed for 1500 minutes and 1200 minutes. After an 850 minute long quiescent entrainment phase, the simulations enter into a global non-spherical oscillation that is launched and sustained by individual ignition events of H-rich fluid pockets. Fast circumferential flows collide at the antipode and cause the formation and localized ignition of the next H-overabundant pocket. The cycle repeats for more than a dozen times while its amplitude decreases. During the global oscillation, the entrainment rate increases temporarily by a factor of {$\approx$}100. Entrained entropy quenches convective motions in the upper layer until the burning of entrained H establishes a separate convection zone. The lower-resolution run hints at the possibility that another global oscillation, perhaps even more violent, will follow. The location of the H-burning convection zone agrees with a one-dimensional model in which the mixing efficiency is calibrated to reproduce the light curve. The simulations have been performed at the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer at NCSA.},

Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

  abstract = {In their final stages before undergoing a core-collapse supernova, massive stars may experience mergers between internal shells where carbon (C) and oxygen (O) are consumed as fuels for nuclear burning. This interaction, known as a C-O shell merger, can dramatically alter the internal structure of the star, leading to peculiar nucleosynthesis and potentially influencing the supernova explosion and the propagation of the subsequent supernova shock. Our understanding of the frequency and consequences of C-O shell mergers remains limited. This study aims to identify for the first time early diagnostics in the stellar structure which will lead to C-O shell mergers in more advanced stages. We also assess their role in shaping the chemical abundances in the most metal poor stars of the Galaxy. We analyze a set of 209 of stellar evolution models available in the literature, with different initial progenitor masses and metallicities. We then compare the nucleosynthetic yields from a subset of these models with the abundances of odd-Z elements in metal-poor stars. We find that the occurrence of C-O shell mergers in stellar models can be predicted with good approximation based on the outcomes of the central He burning phase, specifically, from the CO core mass (\${\textbackslash}rm M\_\{CO\}\$) and the \${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{12\}C\$ central mass fraction (\${\textbackslash}rm X\_\{C12\}\$): 90\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of models with a C-O merger have \${\textbackslash}rm X\_\{C12\}{$<$} 0.277\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm M\_\{CO\}{$<$} 4.90 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, with average values \${\textbackslash}rm M\_\{CO\} = 4.02 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}rm X\_\{C12\}= 0.176\$. Additionally, we confirm that the Sc-rich and K-rich yields from models with C-O mergers would solve the long-standing underproduction of these elements in massive stars. Our results emphasize the crucial role of C-O shell mergers in enriching the interstellar medium, particularly in the production of odd-Z elements.},

Given its crucial role as an essential element for life, it is especially necessary to uncover the origin of P-rich stars to gain insights into the still unknown nucleosynthetic formation pathways of P in our Galaxy. Our objective is to obtain the extensive chemical abundance inventory of four P-rich stars, covering a large range of heavy elements. This characterization will serve as a milestone for the nuclear astrophysics community to uncover the processes that form the unique chemical fingerprint of P-rich stars. We performed a detailed 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium abundance analysis on the optical UVES spectra of four P-rich stars. Our focus lay on the neutron-capture elements, in particular, on the elements between Sr and Ba, as well as on Pb, as they provide valuable constraints to nucleosynthesis calculations. We compare the obtained abundances with three different nucleosynthetic scenarios: a single i-process, a double i-process, and a combination of s- and i-processes. We have performed the most extensive abundance analysis of P-rich stars to date, including the elements between Sr and Ba, such as Ag, which are rarely measured in any type of stars. We found overabundances with respect to solar in the s-process peak elements, accompanied by an extremely high Ba abundance and slight enhancements in some elements between Rb and Sn. No global solution explaining all four stars could be found for the nucleosynthetic origin of the pattern. The model that produces the least number of discrepancies in three of the four stars is a combination of s- and i-processes, but the current lack of extensive multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations to follow the occurrence of the i-process in different types of stars makes this scenario highly uncertain.},

Here we report the discovery of 15 phosphorus-rich stars with unusual overabundances of O, Mg, Si, Al, and Ce. Phosphorus-rich stars likely inherit their peculiar chemistry from another nearby stellar source but their intriguing chemical abundance pattern challenge the present stellar nucleosynthesis theoretical predictions. Specific effects such as rotation or advanced nucleosynthesis in convective-reactive regions in massive stars represent the most promising alternatives to explain the existence of phosphorus-rich stars.

They recorded the nucleosynthetic fingerprint of their parent stars and thus serve as valuable probes of these astrophysical sites. The most common types of presolar silicon carbide grains (called mainstream SiC grains) condensed in the outflows of asymptotic giant branch stars. Their measured silicon isotopic abundances are not significantly influenced by nucleosynthesis within the parent star but rather represent the pristine stellar composition. Silicon isotopes can thus be used as a proxy for galactic chemical evolution (GCE). However, the measured correlation of 29Si/28Si versus 30Si/28Si does not agree with any current chemical evolution model. Here, we use a Monte Carlo model to vary nuclear reaction rates within their theoretical or experimental uncertainties and process them through stellar nucleosynthesis and GCE models to study the variation of silicon isotope abundances based on these nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. We find that these uncertainties can indeed be responsible for the discrepancy between measurements and models and that the slope of the silicon isotope correlation line measured in mainstream SiC grains agrees with chemical evolution models within the nuclear reaction rate uncertainties. Our result highlights the importance of future precision reaction rate measurements for resolving the apparent data--model discrepancy.},

  abstract = {We describe the results of 3D numerical simulations of oxygen shell burning and hydrogen core burning in a 23 Msolar stellar model. A detailed comparison is made to stellar mixing-length theory (MLT) for the shell-burning model. Simulations in 2D are significantly different from 3D, in terms of both flow morphology and velocity amplitude. Convective mixing regions are better predicted using a dynamic boundary condition based on the bulk Richardson number than by purely local, static criteria like Schwarzschild or Ledoux. MLT gives a good description of the velocity scale and temperature gradient for shell convection; however, there are other important effects that it does not capture, mostly related to the dynamical motion of the boundaries between convective and nonconvective regions. There is asymmetry between upflows and downflows, so the net kinetic energy flux is not zero. The motion of convective boundaries is a source of gravity waves; this is a necessary consequence of the deceleration of convective plumes. Convective ``overshooting'' is best described as an elastic response by the convective boundary, rather than ballistic penetration of the stable layers by turbulent eddies. The convective boundaries are rife with internal and interfacial wave motions, and a variety of instabilities arise that induce mixing through a process best described as turbulent entrainment. We find that the rate at which material entrainment proceeds at the boundaries is consistent with analogous laboratory experiments and simulation and observation of terrestrial atmospheric mixing. In particular, the normalized entrainment rate E=uE/{$\sigma$}H is well described by a power-law dependence on the bulk Richardson number RiB={$\Delta$}bL/{$\sigma$}2H for the conditions studied, 20{$<$}{\textasciitilde}RiB{$<$}{\textasciitilde}420. We find E=ARi-nB, with best-fit values logA=0.027+/-0.38 and n=1.05+/-0.21. We discuss the applicability of these results to stellar evolution calculations.},

The key motivation is to capture the large-scale mixing and asymmetries in the wake of the shell merger before collapse using a self-consistent approach. The 4{$\pi$} geometry is crucial, as it allows us to follow the growth and evolution of convective modes on the largest possible scales. We find significant differences between the kinematic, thermodynamic, and chemical evolution of the 3D and 1D models. The 3D model shows vigorous convection leading to more efficient mixing of nuclear species. In the 3D case, the entire oxygen shell attains convective Mach numbers of {$\approx$}0.1, whereas in the 1D model, the convective velocities are much lower, and there is negligible overshooting across convective boundaries. In the 3D case, the convective eddies entrain nuclear species from the neon (and carbon) layers into the deeper part of the oxygen-burning shell, where they burn and power a violent convection phase with outflows. This is a prototypical model of a convective--reactive system. Due to the strong convection and resulting efficient mixing, the interface between the neon layer and the silicon-enriched oxygen layer disappears during the evolution, and silicon is mixed far out into the merged oxygen/neon shell. Neon entrained inward by convective downdrafts burns, resulting in lower neon mass in the 3D model compared to the 1D model at the time of collapse. In addition, the 3D model develops remarkable large-scale, large-amplitude asymmetries, which may have important implications for the impending gravitational collapse and subsequent explosion.},

Nucleosynthesis calculations indicate that these supernovae could be contributors of some lighter neutron-rich elements beyond iron. The explosion mechanism of more massive stars remains under investigation, although first 3D models of neutrino-driven explosions employing multi-group neutrino transport have become available. Together with earlier 2D models and more simplified 3D simulations, these have elucidated the interplay between neutrino heating and hydrodynamic instabilities in the post-shock region that is essential for shock revival. However, some physical ingredients may still need to be added/improved before simulations can robustly explain supernova explosions over a wide range of progenitors. Solutions recently suggested in the literature include uncertainties in the neutrino rates, rotation, and seed perturbations from convective shell burning. We review the implications of 3D simulations of shell burning in supernova progenitors for the `perturbations-aided neutrino-driven mechanism,' whose efficacy is illustrated by the first successful multi-group neutrino hydrodynamics simulation of an 18 solar mass progenitor with 3D initial conditions. We conclude with speculations about the impact of 3D effects on the structure of massive stars through convective boundary mixing.},

  abstract = {The slow neutron capture process in massive stars (weak s process) produces most of the s-process isotopes between iron and strontium. Neutrons are provided by the 22Ne({$\alpha$},n)25Mg reaction, which is activated at the end of the convective He-burning core and in the subsequent convective C-burning shell. The s-process-rich material in the supernova ejecta carries the signature of these two phases. In the past years, new measurements of neutron capture cross sections of isotopes beyond iron significantly changed the predicted weak s-process distribution. The reason is that the variation of the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) is propagated to heavier isotopes along the s path. In the light of these results, we present updated nucleosynthesis calculations for a 25 M{$\Sun$} star of Population I (solar metallicity) in convective He-burning core and convective C-burning shell conditions. In comparison with previous simulations based on the Bao et al. compilation, the new measurement of neutron capture cross sections leads to an increase of s-process yields from nickel up to selenium. The variation of the cross section of one isotope along the s-process path is propagated to heavier isotopes, where the propagation efficiency is higher for low cross sections. New 74Ge, 75As, and 78Se MACS result in a higher production of germanium, arsenic, and selenium, thereby reducing the s-process yields of heavier elements by propagation. Results are reported for the He core and for the C shell. In shell C-burning, the s-process nucleosynthesis is more uncertain than in the He core, due to higher MACS uncertainties at higher temperatures. We also analyze the impact of using the new lower solar abundances for CNO isotopes on the s-process predictions, where CNO is the source of 22Ne, and we show that beyond Zn this is affecting the s-process yields more than nuclear or stellar model uncertainties considered in this paper. In particular, using the new updated initial composition, we obtain a high s-process production (overproduction higher than 16O, {$\sim$}100) for Cu, Ga, Ge, and As. Using the older abundances by Anders \& Grevesse, also Se, Br, Kr, and Rb are efficiently produced. Our results have important implications in explaining the origin of copper in the solar abundance distribution, pointing to a prevailing contribution from the weak s-process in agreement with spectroscopic observations and Galactic chemical evolution calculations. Because of the improvement due to the new MACS for nickel and copper isotopes, the nucleosynthesis of copper is less affected by nuclear uncertainties compared to heavier s-process elements. An experimental determination of the 63Ni MACS is required for a further improvement of the abundance prediction of copper. The available spectroscopic observations of germanium and gallium in stars are also discussed, where most of the cosmic abundances of these elements derives from the s-process in massive stars.},

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M{$\Sun$} star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

  abstract = {The increasing exoplanet catalogue of terrestrial to super-Earth sized rocky planets has necessitated approaches to address their surface conditions, degassing, tectonics, and habitability. One of the key unknowns is the spectrum of compositional endmembers, particularly in geophysically critical elements such as Fe (relative to Si), and heat producing elements (HPEs), including U, Th and K. The fractional distribution of these elements determines core size, gravity, and internal temperatures, which govern the geodynamics of rocky planets. Whilst the relative proportions of these elements can vary enormously in solar-system bodies, on long timescales, galactic chemical evolution (GCE) predicates the availability of these elements for building rocky planets. Existing models demonstrate a systematic dilution of heat producing elements over time, and an increase in Fe/Si due to increased Type Ia supernova activity since galaxy formation. Here we test the consequences of these trends for terrestrial planet behaviour. We assume an Earth-type planet - i.e., planets that accreted similarly to Earth, and inherited elements in a similar partitioning ratio as Earth to the Sun. We varied their Fe/Si ratios, and thus core size, and use a mineral physics package to calculate internal structures, physical properties, and gravity. Planets forming early in the Milky Way's history tend to have low Fe/Si ratios, and thus small cores, although elevated HPE budgets. The configuration of convection in planets that have large mantle fractions relative to the Earth tends to focus stress in the lithosphere and promote tectonic activity. Together with lower gravity, and thus weaker surface faults, plate tectonic behaviour is enhanced in small-core planets. In contrast, planets forming currently have higher Fe/Si, core size, higher gravity, and a lower propensity to plate tectonics. Our results imply a high-propensity for plate tectonics on Earth-sized planets early in galactic history, with the tendency for tectonics diminishing as the galaxy evolved.},

  abstract = {Discoveries of rocky worlds around other stars have inspired diverse geophysical models of their plausible structures and tectonic regimes. Severe limitations of observable properties require many inexact assumptions about key geophysical characteristics of these planets. We present the output of an analytical galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model that quantitatively constrains one of those key properties: radiogenic heating. Earth's radiogenic heat generation has evolved since its formation, and the same will apply to exoplanets. We have fit simulations of the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium in the solar annulus to the chemistry of our Solar System at the time of its formation and then applied the carbonaceous chondrite/Earth's mantle ratio to determine the chemical composition of what we term ``cosmochemically Earth-like'' exoplanets. Through this approach, predictions of exoplanet radiogenic heat productions as a function of age have been derived. The results show that the later a planet forms in galactic history, the less radiogenic heat it begins with; however, due to radioactive decay, today, old planets have lower heat outputs per unit mass than newly formed worlds. The long half-life of 232Th allows it to continue providing a small amount of heat in even the most ancient planets, while 40K dominates heating in young worlds. Through constraining the age-dependent heat production in exoplanets, we can infer that younger, hotter rocky planets are more likely to be geologically active and therefore able to sustain the crustal recycling (e.g. plate tectonics) that may be a requirement for long-term biosphere habitability. In the search for Earth-like planets, the focus should be made on stars within a billion years or so of the Sun's age.},

Recent advances in computing resources have enabled 3D stellar models to reproduce longer time scales and include nuclear reactions, making the simulations more accurate and allowing to study explicit nucleosynthesis. Here, we present results from 3D stellar simulations of a convective neon-burning shell from a 20 M{$\odot$} star, run with an explicit nuclear network from its early development to complete fuel exhaustion. We show that convection halts when fuel is exhausted, stopping its further growth after the entrainment of fresh material.

A common approach consists in adopting concepts and methods derived from the classical mixing length theory (MLT), but the results seem to depend critically on the actual sequence of operations followed in estimating overshooting distances. In this paper several versions of the MLT approach to overshooting from convective cores are analyzed, and it is argued that a confusion between local and nonlocal quantities introduces a fatal physical inconsistency, which invalidates the corresponding overshooting algorithms used in stellar evolutionary calculations. It is further argued that the MLT is unlikely to provide an adequate description of convective overshooting, and possible alternatives are briefly discussed.},

We summarize striking new results: (1) strong interactions occur between active carbon- and oxygen-burning shells; (2) hydrodynamic wave motions in nonconvective regions, generated at the convective-radiative boundaries, are energetically important in both two and three dimensions, with important consequences for compositional mixing; and (3) a spectrum of mixed p- and g-modes are unambiguously identified with corresponding adiabatic waves in these computational domains.

We devise closures of the Reynolds-decomposed mean field equations by simple physical modeling of the simulations (we relate temperature and density fluctuations via coefficients); the procedure (Convection Algorithm Based on Simulations) is terrestrially testable and is amenable to systematic improvement. We develop a turbulent kinetic energy equation which contains both nonlocal and time-dependent terms, and is appropriate if the convective transit time is shorter than the evolutionary timescale. The interpretation of mixing-length theory (MLT) as generally used in astrophysics is incorrect; MLT forces the mixing length to be an imposed constant. Direct tests show that the damping associated with the flow is that suggested by Kolmogorov ({$\varepsilon$} K {$\approx$} {$\rho$}(u')3 rms/ell D , where ell D is the size of the largest eddy and (u')rms is the local rms turbulent velocity). This eddy size is approximately the depth of the convection zone ellCZ in our simulations, and corresponds in some respects to the mixing length of MLT. New terms involving the local heating due to turbulent dissipation should appear in the stellar evolutionary equations, and are not guaranteed to be negligible. The enthalpy flux (stellar "convective luminosity") is directly connected to the buoyant acceleration, and hence to the scale of convective velocity. MLT tends to systematically underestimate the velocity scale, which affects estimates of chromospheric and coronal heating, mass loss, and wave generation. Quantitative comparison with a variety of 3D simulations reveals a previously unrecognized consistency. Extension of this approach to deal with rotational shear and MHD is indicated. Examples of application to stellar evolution will be presented in subsequent papers in this series.},

  abstract = {Renzini wrote an influential critique of ``overshooting'' in mixing-length theory (MLT), as used in stellar evolution codes, and concluded that three-dimensional fluid dynamical simulations were needed. Such simulations are now well tested. Implicit large eddy simulations connect large-scale stellar flow to a turbulent cascade at the grid scale, and allow the simulation of turbulent boundary layers, with essentially no assumptions regarding flow except the number of computational cells. Buoyant driving balances turbulent dissipation for weak stratification, as in MLT, but with the dissipation length replacing the mixing length. The turbulent kinetic energy in our computational domain shows steady pulses after 30 turnovers, with no discernible diminution; these are caused by the necessary lag in turbulent dissipation behind acceleration. Interactions between coherent turbulent structures give multi-modal behavior, which drives intermittency and fluctuations. These cause mixing, which may justify use of the instability criterion of Schwarzschild rather than the Ledoux. Chaotic shear flow of turning material at convective boundaries causes instabilities that generate waves and sculpt the composition gradients and boundary layer structures. The flow is not anelastic; wave generation is necessary at boundaries. A self-consistent approach to boundary layers can remove the need for ad hoc procedures of ``convective overshooting'' and ``semi-convection.'' In Paper II, we quantify the adequacy of our numerical resolution in a novel way, determine the length scale of dissipation---the ``mixing length''---without astronomical calibration, quantify agreement with the four-fifths law of Kolmogorov for weak stratification, and deal with strong stratification.},

  abstract = {Stellar evolution models of massive stars are important for many areas of astrophysics, for example nucleosynthesis yields, supernova progenitor models and understanding physics under extreme conditions. Turbulence occurs in stars primarily due to nuclear burning at different mass coordinates within the star. The understanding and correct treatment of turbulence and turbulent mixing at convective boundaries in stellar models has been studied for decades but still lacks a definitive solution. This paper presents initial results of a study on convective boundary mixing (CBM) in massive stars. The `stiffness' of a convective boundary can be quantified using the bulk Richardson number (\{\{Ri\}\}\{\{B\}\}), the ratio of the potential energy for restoration of the boundary to the kinetic energy of turbulent eddies. A `stiff' boundary (\{\{Ri\}\}\{\{B\}\}{$\sim$} \{10\}4) will suppress CBM, whereas in the opposite case a `soft' boundary (\{\{Ri\}\}\{\{B\}\}{$\sim$} 10) will be more susceptible to CBM. One of the key results obtained so far is that lower convective boundaries (closer to the centre) of nuclear burning shells are `stiffer' than the corresponding upper boundaries, implying limited CBM at lower shell boundaries. This is in agreement with 3D hydrodynamic simulations carried out by Meakin and Arnett (2007 Astrophys. J. 667 448-75). This result also has implications for new CBM prescriptions in massive stars as well as for nuclear burning flame front propagation in super-asymptotic giant branch stars and also the onset of novae.},

  abstract = {Recent 3D simulations have suggested that convective seed perturbations from shell burning can play an important role in triggering neutrino-driven supernova explosions. Since isolated simulations cannot determine whether this perturbation-aided mechanism is of general relevance across the progenitor mass range, we here investigate the pertinent properties of convective oxygen and silicon burning shells in a broad range of pre-supernova stellar evolution models. We find that conditions for perturbation-aided explosions are most favourable in the extended oxygen shells of progenitors between about 16 and 26 solar masses, which exhibit large-scale convective overturn with high convective Mach numbers. Although the highest convective Mach numbers of up to 0.3 are reached in the oxygen shells of low-mass progenitors, convection is typically dominated by small-scale modes in these shells, which implies a more modest role of initial perturbations in the explosion mechanism. Convective silicon burning rarely provides the high Mach numbers and large-scale perturbations required for perturbation-aided explosions. We also find that about 40 per cent of progenitors between 16 and 26 solar masses exhibit simultaneous oxygen and neon burning in the same convection zone as a result of a shell merger shortly before collapse.},

In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) simulations of these phenomena have matured significantly. Considerable progress has been made towards identifying the ingredients for shock revival by the neutrino-driven mechanism, and successful explosions have already been obtained in a number of self-consistent 3D models. These advances also bring new challenges, however. Prompted by a need for increased physical realism and meaningful model validation, supernova theory is now moving towards a more integrated view that connects multi-dimensional phenomena in the late convective burning stages prior to collapse, the explosion engine, and mixing instabilities in the supernova envelope. Here we review our current understanding of multi-D fluid flow in core-collapse supernovae and their progenitors. We start by outlining specific challenges faced by hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and of the late convective burning stages. We then discuss recent advances and open questions in theory and simulations.},

  abstract = {The production of the neutron-capture isotopes beyond iron that we observe today in the Solar system is the result of the combined contribution of the r-process, the s-process, and possibly the i-process. Low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) (1.5 {$<$} M/M{$\odot$} {$<$} 3) and massive (M {$>$} 10 M{$\odot$}) stars have been identified as the main site of the s-process. In this work we consider the evolution and nucleosynthesis of low-mass AGB stars. We provide an update of the NuGrid Set models, adopting the same general physics assumptions but using an updated convective-boundary-mixing model accounting for the contribution from internal gravity waves. The combined data set includes the initial masses MZAMS/M{$\odot$} = 2, 3 for Z = 0.03, 0.02, 0.01. These new models are computed with the MESA stellar code and the evolution is followed up to the end of the AGB phase. The nucleosynthesis was calculated for all isotopes in post-processing with the NuGrid mppnp code. The convective-boundary-mixing model leads to the formation of a 13C-pocket three times wider compared to the one obtained in the previous set of models, bringing the simulation results now in closer agreement with observations. Using these new models, we discuss the potential impact of other processes inducing mixing, like rotation, adopting parametric models compatible with theory and observations. Complete yield data tables, derived data products, and online analytic data access are provided.},

Our non-rotating models assume convective boundary mixing (CBM) where it has been adopted before. We include 8 (12) initial masses for Z = 0.01 (0.02). Models are followed either until the end of the asymptotic giant branch phase or the end of Si burning, complemented by simple analytic core-collapse supernova (SN) models with two options for fallback and shock velocities. The explosions show which pre-SN yields will most strongly be effected by the explosive nucleosynthesis. We discuss how these two explosion parameters impact the light elements and the s and p process.

All post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations use the same nuclear reaction rate network and nuclear physics input.

Unlike lower-mass stars (M{$<$}{\textasciitilde}8Msolar), however, no point is ever reached at which a massive star can be fully supported by electron degeneracy. Instead, the center evolves to ever higher temperatures, fusing ever heavier elements until a core of iron is produced. The collapse of this iron core to a neutron star releases an enormous amount of energy, a tiny fraction of which is sufficient to explode the star as a supernova. The authors examine our current understanding of the lives and deaths of massive stars, with special attention to the relevant nuclear and stellar physics. Emphasis is placed upon their post-helium-burning evolution. Current views regarding the supernova explosion mechanism are reviewed, and the hydrodynamics of supernova shock propagation and ``fallback'' is discussed. The calculated neutron star masses, supernova light curves, and spectra from these model stars are shown to be consistent with observations. During all phases, particular attention is paid to the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Such stars are capable of producing, with few exceptions, the isotopes between mass 16 and 88 as well as a large fraction of still heavier elements made by the r and p processes.},

A time-dependent diffusion model based on a vibrational instability analysis is adopted in order to describe mixing of layers having a gradient of mean molecular weight (semiconvection). The fully-convective layers are determined according to the Ledoux criterion. For comparison, evolutionary sequences are also calculated for the same masses without assuming semiconvection but using the Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability. It is found that the vibrational instability does not establish the Schwarzschild-Haerm criterion for semiconvection during the fast phases of evolution, such as shell hydrogen burning. The modification of the chemical profile by semiconvection during this phase does strongly affect the evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram during core helium burning. The results are discussed in comparison to earlier calculations of massive star evolution with and without inclusion of semiconvection.},
