# XRISM Collaboration

Sato et al detected P, Cl, and K in Cas A with XRISM and find in their analysis that shell mergers are relevant to the observed elemental abundances.
They used the Ritter+2018 letter to discuss the nucleosynthesis, but the referee comments said they need to explore the details of the merger-driven production mechanisms with more depth which is why they are reaching out to us.

They want to revise the paper and resubmit to Nature sometime in the next three months.
For their paper they want to do the following:
1. Scale back discussions of chemical evolution and explosion mechanisms, and instead delve deeply into the details of the nucleosynthesis processes.
2. Incorporate full observational details and discussions of phosphorus, chlorine, and potassium into the main text. Furthermore, expand the theoretical treatment of the even-Z/odd-Z abundance trends to give a more robust interpretation.

They would appreciate us help to interprete the observation results and understanding the current theoretical uncertainties.

- Also interested in the electron fraction distribution in shell-merged progenitors because asymmetry in distrubtion of Ye is possible for iron group elements. This is discussed in their submitted ApJ paper.
